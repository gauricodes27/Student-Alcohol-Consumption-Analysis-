## Student Alcohol Consumption Analysis
🔨Tools Used: Python (Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

🏢Team Size: 6 | Role: Data Analyst & Visualizer

🌐Overview: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on survey data from secondary school students enrolled in Math and Portuguese courses to understand patterns in alcohol consumption. The project explored how demographic, academic, and social factors influence alcohol use among teenagers.

🧩Key Contributions:Assisted in data preparation by combining datasets and performing initial data cleaning and wrangling. Contributed to visual analysis by creating clear, well-labeled plots (boxplots, bar charts, violin plots, heatmaps) to examine correlations between alcohol consumption and variables such as gender, family structure, academic performance, and social behavior. Supported interpretation of results to derive behavioral insights.

👋🏽Key Outcomes:Strengthened skills in Python-based EDA, data visualization, and behavioral data interpretation. Gained hands-on experience analyzing real-world datasets to identify social trends and correlations.
